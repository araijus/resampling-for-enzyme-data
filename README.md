# resampling-for-enzyme-data
Resampling techniques (Random Oversampling, Gaussian Noise, SMOTE, ADASYN) are applied to check whether they can improve predictive performance of models based on a set of protein embeddings. Resampling codes borrowed from ImbalancedLearningRegression package developed by Branco et al. Additional preprocessing steps applied: feature selection and data discretization.
